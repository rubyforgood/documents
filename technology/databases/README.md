# Databases

## Main principles

_Use only database providers which have free community versions (i.e. do not lock yourself into provider)_

Examples:
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- MongoDB
- MySQL / MariaDB
- Apache Cassandra
- etc.

You will always have an option to use DBaaS version of corresponding DB, the same time having free version will simplify local development, CI, etc.

Use DB which fits best into project profile, usually SQL general purpose DB is recommended

## PostgreSQL

PostreSQL is first recommendation for general purpose SQL database

Use it unless you ahve strong case why to use anything else
